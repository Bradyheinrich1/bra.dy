            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I've been building startups since 2018, and I've seen the same problem over and over: businesses struggle to get visible online. Traditional SEO is expensive and complicated. Most companies either overpay for mediocre results or give up entirely.</p>
                
                <p>Then AI search engines started showing up everywhere. ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity—people aren't just searching on Google anymore. And I realized businesses needed help navigating this new landscape.</p>
                
                <p>That's why I built Clutch Click AI. It's an AI visibility platform that helps businesses show up wherever their customers are searching—whether that's Google, ChatGPT, or anywhere else.</p>
                
                <h2>What We Built</h2>
                
                <p>We built two things, really. A platform you can use yourself to track and optimize your AI visibility. And an agency team that does the work for you if you'd rather focus on running your business.</p>
                
                <p>Both work. It's flexible. Some people want control, others want someone else to handle it. We built it so you can choose what makes sense for your business.</p>
                
                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                
                <p>Organic visibility shouldn't be something only big companies with huge budgets can afford. Too many businesses are getting left behind because SEO feels impossible or too expensive.</p>
                
                <p>We're trying to change that. Whether you use the platform yourself or have our team manage everything, the goal is the same: help your business grow organically through SEO, AI SEO, and AEO (AI Engine Optimization).</p>
                
                <p>It's been months in the making. We listened to what people actually needed—tools that work, flexibility in how they engage with us, and results that scale with their business.</p>
                
                <p>I'm excited about what we've built and what we can help businesses achieve. If you're trying to get visible online, whether you're a startup or a larger company, we built this for you.</p>
