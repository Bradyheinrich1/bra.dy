                <h2>The AGI Takeover</h2>
                
                <p>Picture this: AGI arrives, and suddenly robotics is everywhere. Robots build roads, repair bridges, and perform brain surgery like it's routine. AI takes over the boring knowledge work—taxes, legal paperwork, customer support, all of it. For basic needs, scarcity mostly disappears.</p>
                
                <h2>Bureaucracy Becomes Obsolete</h2>
                
                <p>In a world like that, traditional government services start to feel… outdated. Why keep massive bureaucracies running hospitals, schools, and welfare offices when AI and robots can deliver better results faster and cheaper?</p>
                
                <h2>UBI and UBS: The Ultimate Libertarian Move</h2>
                
                <p>Here's the part that really messes with people's expectations: Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Universal Basic Services (UBS) wouldn't be some stealth version of socialism. They'd actually be the most techno-libertarian move imaginable.</p>
                
                <p>Think about it. Instead of the government owning everything or micromanaging people through dozens of programs, you get a simple income floor plus guaranteed access to essentials—healthcare, education, basic housing—run by ultra-efficient automated systems. No means testing. No caseworkers. No endless forms. Just a clean baseline for everyone.</p>
                
                <h2>Dismantling the Old State</h2>
                
                <p>That means you can dismantle huge chunks of the old welfare state. Automate or sell off things like the DMV, public works, even parts of defense logistics. Then tax the insane productivity gains from AI and robot labor to fund the basics. Everyone gets what they need to survive, and the market—now supercharged—handles the rest. Freedom goes up. Coercion goes down. That's closer to libertarian heaven than a collectivist nightmare.</p>
                
                <h2>The Upgraded Human</h2>
                
                <p>And humans? We don't just sit around doing nothing. We merge with AI. Brain-computer links, neural upgrades, whatever comes next. One person directs a swarm of surgical robots. Another designs entire cities in simulation and lets machines build them overnight. We're not obsolete—we're upgraded pilots in a god-mode economy.</p>
                
                <h2>The Spirit of Striving Lives On</h2>
                
                <p>What about the American entrepreneurial spirit? It doesn't disappear. Striving is baked into us.</p>
                
                <p>People will still chase status, adventure, creation, and legacy. Some will launch insane new startups. Others will make art that melts brains. Some will explore space, dominate extreme sports, or compete in massive virtual worlds. You'll still hustle, because humans love building things and beating yesterday's version of themselves.</p>
                
                <h2>From Desperation to Aspiration</h2>
                
                <p>UBI and UBS just remove the desperation. No more "work or starve." Only upside motivation.</p>
                
                <p>Sure, some people will coast. That's fine. Others will go harder than ever because the basics are covered and the ceiling is limitless.</p>
                
                <p>This isn't a world without effort. It's a world where effort shifts to what actually matters: meaning, creativity, and exploration.</p>
